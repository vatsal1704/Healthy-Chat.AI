# 🩺 Health-Chat.AI
**Health Chat AI** is an intelligent health assistant built with **Streamlit** and powered by **Gemini 2.5 Pro**. The app allows users to input their **height** and **weight**, calculates their **BMI (Body Mass Index)**, and determines whether they are underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.

Once the BMI is calculated, users can engage in a personalized chat with the AI to ask health-related questions, such as:

- “What are the health risks of being overweight?”
- “How can I lose weight safely?”
- “What should my ideal BMI be?”
- “Can you suggest a basic workout plan for my condition?”

This makes **Health Chat AI** a quick and intelligent companion for users seeking general health advice based on their BMI status.
